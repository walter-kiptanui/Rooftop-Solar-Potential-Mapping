In this project, an analysis of the rooftop solar potential data obtained from a certain area of interest in Nairobi was done. The results obtained from the analysis would be very helpful to a solar company.
For solar installation companies it is proper to do a feasible study before venturing into solar installation project. 

The objectives of the project were:

i. To determine the number of buildings in the area and the energy potential of each house.

ii. To determine the types of buildings in the area.

iii. To determine how the different building characteristics affect the energy potential.

The dataset contains solar rooftop potential data (suitable rooftop area, installable capacity, estimated yearly electricity generation, and building type ) at individual building structure level for a sample area of interest in Nairobi. The data was gathered by extracting building rooftop footprint polygons from very high-resolution satellite stereo imagery of 0.5m resolution. The rooftop angle, obstruction, and shading were taken into account during suitable area calculation. The results can be aggregated by different sectors or administrative units for further analysis, which is useful for planning and decision making. Detailed methodology is available upon specific request.
